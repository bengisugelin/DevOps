Here we see docker client, client can be on the same machine or it can be in a different machine. We will have it on the same machine for this particular application.

We will create a virtual machine, will install Docker engine in that VM and we will have a clients as well. with docker build command, we can build our own images. From the official images, we can pull image.


Let's dive into the hands-on practice:

as always, open gitbash and create a directory.

in that directory, place Vagrantfile.
