Let's see how we can store the variables and can retrieve them fro the bas shell.

store a variable:
```
[root@scriptbox ~]# SKILL="DevOps"
```
to retrieve it, just put a $ signt before the name of the variable:
```
[root@scriptbox ~]#  echo $SKILL
```

here another variable and its usage:
```
[root@scriptbox ~]# PACKAGE = "httpd wget unzip"
[root@scriptbox ~]# yum install $PACKAGE -y
```

Let's implement this knowledge in our Web setup script.

Before we execute this. we will dismantle everything.For that, we will write a script to remove it, actually remove the service and all the data firs,and then we'll execute the script.

now let's run our script.
```
[root@scriptbox scripts]# ./3_vars_websetup.sh
```

let's check the browser:

It works completely fine! YAY!


# Command line arguments

so if we dont want to specify the variable, but enter in the command line here how we can do it:

first lets create a copy of latest websetup.sh file

```
```
and then open it and make the modification.
```
```

Comment URL and ART_NAME. now we dont have those variables. so we are not going to use that variable, but we weill use numbers(0,1,2...) instead.

```
[root@scriptbox scripts]# ./5_args_websetup.sh https://www.tooplate.com/zip-templates/2137_barista_cafe.zip 2137_barista_cafe
```

now this is a resusable code, i can use it any different website by giving the address of the website.

so, let's get the ip and see it on the browser.

## Exporting variables.

If you want to make a variable permanent, you can do it by placing it in the .bashrc file
