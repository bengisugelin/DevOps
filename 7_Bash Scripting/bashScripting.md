# VM Setup

in this session, we will create three virtual machines where we can practice our bash scripts.

First, you need to create a directory somewhere in your system and put the vagrant file in it.

Lets bring it up the the first one (scriptbox)

```
$ vagrant up scriptbox
```

log in to it
```
$ vagrant ssh scriptbox
```

be a root user and set a hostname
```
[root@scriptbox ~]# hostname scriptbox
```

now, we will write our first script and we will place it in a directory..

```
[root@scriptbox ~]# mkdir /opt/scripts
[root@scriptbox ~]# cd /opt/scripts/
[root@scriptbox scripts]# ls
```

were going to install vim first.

```
[root@scriptbox scripts]# yum install vim -y
```
then, create an sh file for bash scripting.
```

[root@scriptbox scripts]# vim firstscript.sh
```

when we tried to execute it, we will get an permission denied error.

in order to run it, we need to give executable permission

```
[root@scriptbox scripts]# chmod +x firstscript.sh
```
now if we run it, it should work.

but. let's make the output more readable.
