We will talk about AWS CLI (Command line interface)

What we rae doing through the console or graphically, can also be done through the CLI. Let's see how we can find out commands for our tasks and execute them.

But before that, we should have AWS CLI installed on our computer. 

If you're using windows: open pwershell as an admin

```
choco install awscli
```

Now, let's open gitbash:

```
$ aws --version
```

next step is configuring AWS CLI. You need to have an IAM user. Go to IAM service -> Users -> add(create) users
