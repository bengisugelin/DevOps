### EFS - Elastic file system.

If you need a shared storage on AWS, then we can go with EFS. We can mount EFS file system on any directory in our operating system, and as AWS says, it's scalable, elastic, cloud-native NFS file system.

We can use it for containers and serverless applications, analytics and machine learning, web serving and content management, media & entertainment, or Database backups.
