S3 is one of the most popular service of AWS and also the oldest one. One of the oldest one.

Let's see what is S3..So S3 is a storage service and you can access it over the Internet. You can store any amount of data in s3 bucket at any time, and you can access it from anywhere.

the data that you store is object and the storage is called bucket. The bucket name has to be unique. it is a logical unit of storage on AWS. 

Amazon S3->Bucket -> Folder ->Object -> public access


S3 Storage Classes:

1. **S3 Standard** : General purpose storage of frequently accessed data. Fast access & object replication in multi AZ.
2. **S3 IA-Infrequent Access** : Long-lived, but less frequently accessed data. Slow accsess, object replication in multi AZ
3. **S3 One Zone - IA** : is for data that is accessed less frequently, but requires rapid access when needed. Slow access, no object replication.
4. **S3 Intelligent Tiering** : Automatically moves data to most cost effective tier.
5. **S3 Galcier** : low cost storage class for data archiving.
6. **S3 Glacier Deep Archive** : Lowest cost storage, retrieval time of 12 hours.


Lifecycle policies: storage can be changes according to the age. for instance, if the data is only for 30 days it will be S3standard, after 30 days, will be S3 IA-infrequent Access and after 90 days, will be S3 glacier.

and create your bucket.

After creating it, you can see objects, properties, permissions, meti=rics, management and access points.

go to object, click on upload, click dd files, then we can browse our destop and choose the file we want, choose them and click add file.

By default, the storage class will be standard, but you can choose anything you want.


Here, like we hosted website on EC@ instance, we will put all that data into S3 bucket and host the website from the S3 bucket.

extrat the zip file, and then copy all the files and data inside this folder and upload to the s2 bucket.

after uploading the files to the S3 bucket, go to the permisison and remove all the checks (uncheck all of them). You shouldnt block the public access. Next, we're going the make all this data public, so select all data we have in the bucket-> Action-> make public.

in the properties, scroll down to the end, there is a section names static website hosting. click edit and enable static website hosting. Specifiy index document and error.html file. but remember, we can only host static websites in S3 bucket.
