# Accounts needed
## Github ( Obviously ðŸ˜ƒ)
## Domain ( eg. GoDaddy)
We will need this domain to do some real time or production use cases and in order to perform those steps, which we use in real time, we will need a domain.
## DockerHub
[https://hub.docker.com/] sign up , choose a free plan. We are going to store our docker images on this in the Docker projects
## SonarCloud
You can sign up with your github account. Create a project for yourself with a unique name.
# AWS
## Free Tier Account
Create a free tier account. Then, when you tried to sign in, you will see two options, root user and IAM user. Account we created is a root user. 
1. **Check if your account is active or not:** we can do a small test here. You can search for service EC2 ( virtual machine service). Ehwn you cliked it, if you see its details such as Instances, deedicated hosts, Elastic IPs etc, it means that your account is active. Otherwise, we eill get some error in that section such as verify your phone etc.
 ## IAM with MFA
3. **Create a user :** The user we have created is a root user, and it is not recommended to usig root user for services. Therefore, we will create another user which is called IAM user. In the search bar, write iam user and find IAM, click on it. First thing is adding an MFA, which is a multi-factor authentication. Here, you need to install a software on your phone, which is google authenticator and it is going to show six digit code when we tried to log in to the account, you need to enter that MFA along with you password. MFA device can also be a Security key ( YubiKey or other supported FIDO security key.) or Hardware TOTP (time-based one time password) token. 
   - click add MFA >> click assign MFA >> MFA device is basically your phone. Choose Authenticator app, click on Next, now, install the google authenticator to your phone. Then Open your authenticator app, chose Show QR code on the website page, the use the app to scan the code. Then enter the MFA codes
