# Intro to Vagrant

```
$ cd /c/vagrant-vms/ubuntu18/
$ vagrant global-status
id       name    provider   state    directory
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
7d71c6b  default virtualbox poweroff C:/vagrant-vms/centos7
088c744  default virtualbox poweroff C:/vagrant-vms/ubuntu18

The above shows information about all known Vagrant environments
on this machine. This data is cached and may not be completely
up-to-date (use "vagrant global-status --prune" to prune invalid
entries). To interact with any of the machines, you can go to that
directory and run Vagrant, or you can use the ID directly with
Vagrant commands from any directory. For example:
"vagrant destroy 1a2b3c4d"
```

So right now, we have two virtual machines running with vagrant
```
$ vagrant status
Current machine states:

default                   poweroff (virtualbox)

The VM is powered off. To restart the VM, simply run `vagrant up`

```
in ubuntu, if you create a file beginning with a dot, this file will be hidden file. to see it:
```
$ ls -a
./  ../  .vagrant/  Vagrantfile  ubuntu-bionic-18.04-cloudimg-console.log
```
If you want to make any change to the VM, you can open the Vagrantfile above. 

In the Vagrant file:


**config.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.25.12"** -> If i uncomment this line , then i can have a static IP address. In double quotes, you can give an IP address you'd like to assign, Make sure it does not overlap with your network IP address

**config.vm.network "public_network"** -> this command line is going to fetch an IP address from a wireless router. So it will be dynamic

We can also change the RAM size. If you want to increase or decrease it, you can do it by uncommenting  vb.memory and relation sections:

```
config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb| -> **uncommented**
  #   # Display the VirtualBox GUI when booting the machine
  #   vb.gui = true
  #
  #   # Customize the amount of memory on the VM:
     vb.memory = "1600" -> **uncommented**
     vb.cpus = 2 
  end -> **uncommented**
```
If you are good with all the settings, save it. You can go back to the git bash and verify the changes using cat command.

```

```

Let's see what files we have in ubuntu directory:
```
/c/vagrant-vms/ubuntu18
$ ls
Vagrantfile  ubuntu-bionic-18.04-cloudimg-console.log
```

Let's create another file:
```
bengi@LAPTOP MINGW64 /c/vagrant-vms/ubuntu18
$ touch testfile123.txt

bengi@LAPTOP MINGW64 /c/vagrant-vms/ubuntu18
$ ls
Vagrantfile  testfile123.txt  ubuntu-bionic-18.04-cloudimg-console.log
```

And a directory:
```
bengi@LAPTOP MINGW64 /c/vagrant-vms/ubuntu18
$ mkdir devopsdir

bengi@LAPTOP MINGW64 /c/vagrant-vms/ubuntu18
$ ls
Vagrantfile  devopsdir/  testfile123.txt  ubuntu-bionic-18.04-cloudimg-console.log
```
When you create VM with vagrant, it will sync the vagrant directory where you have the vagrantfile, in this case, /c/vagrant-vms/ubuntu18 directory. and this directory corresponds /vagrant directory in the vm. So, When we logged in to the VM, if we go to cd /vagrant, we will see the same files&directories we have created in /c/vagrant-vms/ubuntu18 directory.

```
vagrant@ubuntu-bionic:~$ cd /vagrant/
vagrant@ubuntu-bionic:/vagrant$ ls
Vagrantfile  devopsdir  testfile123.txt  ubuntu-bionic-18.04-cloudimg-console.log
```
The beauty of it, you can reach this file from you computer. you dont need spesifically go to the vagrant and open it with vim for instance.

If you want to wwrite some code using some IDE like visual studio or pycharm, you can open your file through one of these IDEs and write your code without connecting the VM. After writing the script, you can use it in the VM.

So, i am creating files in the vagrant, inside the devopsdir directory:
```
vagrant@ubuntu-bionic:/vagrant$ cd devopsdir/
vagrant@ubuntu-bionic:/vagrant/devopsdir$ ls
vagrant@ubuntu-bionic:/vagrant/devopsdir$ touch devopsscripts{1..10}.sh
```

Now, i can see these files from my computer, C:\vagrant-vms\ubuntu18\devopsdir.

I can open one of these bash files using IDE, and start typing:

Let's execute the file:
```
vagrant@ubuntu-bionic:/vagrant$ /vagrant/devopsdir/devopsscripts1.sh

```

**Note** : if you are using graphical editor from Windows such as notepad and executing it in linux, you may get an error. In this case, you should change the format of the file from Windows to unix (usually located in the righet down corner of the IDE).

That was about using a default sync, dir, /vagrant BUT if you want to create your own sync directory, you can do that as well. For that purpose, we need to edit the vagrant file.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113550043/236299043-c13a2ad0-8ad4-4c86-8907-462df87f05f5.png)
We need to uncomment line 46, here, "../data" is the host machine dir path, your computer. and "/vagrant_data" is the VM directory path. VM directory will be created automatically, but the host machine, we have to create it. 

LEt's say you have some data in your host machine, or if you want to preserve the data from hte VM in the host machine, in your laptop, create a directory (vagrant_myshellscripts)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113550043/236300219-17462e2f-6c41-4b5f-91c8-535b6d91a0b3.png)

and copy the files inside the devopsdir directory we have created. ( or whatever data you want to put)

Now, we need to change the path in our Vagrantfile:
